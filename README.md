## Getting Started

Download Spyder, a link is stored under Prerequisites, after that you can run the code through there and edit as you please.
Proof of Work: line 11-43 
Proof of Luck: line 60-121

other than that below is the most updated print out so far:

## Prerequisites

This can be ran through Spyder IDE below is where it can be downloaded:
https://www.spyder-ide.org

## How to Run

Once the IDE is running you can copy the main code and run it. All libraries are on the IDE

## Known Issues

There is a counter that isnt working right now. This is a new error we encountered towards the end of the research,
a resolution that can work may be to define one of the counters as counter1 so we do not get an assertion error in return.

## References

If you need any help with code and prefer to use some here are a few I found helpful throughout my research with Dr. Sanaz Moosavi:
- https://github.com/MSAP-for-UCI-GREAT-Program/PoEWAL
- [Pervasive and mobile computing.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/249)
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1574119220301279
  (Article name: 'PoEWAL: A lightweight consensus mechanism for blockchain in IoT')
  This article is important as it gave very good information on what we were trying to achieve.

## License

The code is open-source but not yet licensed.
This has been research so far Dr. Sanaz Moosavi and Isis Herrarte are the creators of this code.
